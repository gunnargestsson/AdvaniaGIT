# AdvaniaGIT
Source Control Management for NAV C/AL

Script Folder

TestDevel.ps1 can be used to debug the scripts.
Every action will start by calling Start-CustomAction from the GIT client.

When debugging in Administration mode open PowerShell ISE in Administration mode and run the scripts with InAdminMode = $false

The solution is made by Gunnar Gestsson (http://navision.guru), ©Advania (http://www.advania.is)
Some of the scripts in the AdvaniaGIT folder are inspired and/or copied from Kamil Sacek (https://github.com/kine)
